Thick, Rich Shoyu Ramen ‚Äì A dark, soy sauce-heavy broth with lots of backfat (kotteri style), creating a bold, savory experience.

Rich, Oily Broth: Some variations include an extra layer of pork backfat (seabura), making it extra creamy and hearty.
Kyoto‚Äôs Historical Influence: Kyoto‚Äôs food culture often favors slightly sweet, umami-packed flavors, and this carries over into the ramen broth.
Serving Style:
Kyoto Ramen is often served with thinly sliced chashu pork, menma (bamboo shoots), and a soft-boiled egg. Some shops even add black pepper, garlic, or spicy miso for an extra kick.

It‚Äôs a must-try for those who love deep, bold flavors, and it has gained popularity outside Kyoto due to its hearty, satisfying taste!
